"""ODTools Python Functions"""

Most of the tools have been designed with the ability to use them within other scripts in mind.  You can use them by simply importing the shelftools module.

NOTE:
    This function can also be called via python.

    {{{
    #!python
    from OD import shelftools

    # you then can just type shelftools. and will get a list of all the available functions
    }}}
