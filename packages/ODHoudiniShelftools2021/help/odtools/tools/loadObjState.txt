"""Loads a template file of stored display states"""

You can load a file thats saved with "Save /obj Display State" which restores the display flag state of current /obj level nodes to the ones from the saved file.  This makes it very easy to switch on/off certain items for a variety of use cases, together with "Set as Viewport Camera with State" allows you to quickly change the visibility of items for specific camera views.
