"""Saves a template file of stored display states"""

You can save a file that can be loaded with "Load /obj Display State" which stores the display flag state of current /obj level nodes.  This makes it very easy to switch on/off certain items for a variety of use cases, together with "Set as Viewport Camera with State" allows you to quickly change the visibility of items for specific camera views.
