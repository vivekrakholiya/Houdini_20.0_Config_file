= OBJ Node Transforms to Sop Points =

"""Takes Object Level Transforms and converts them into sop level points"""

You can select one or multiple object level nodes, and a point is created for each of them on sop level.  The point will have the position/orient and scale attributes of the object level node.  This process can make it very easy to either parent a sop node to an obj level transform, or to set things up for instancing.
