= Export Node Network =

"""Allows the export of nodes that were saved via the Export Node Network."""

This makes it easy to load/save specific setups and exchange them between sessions of Houdini.  Simply select a node, or a subnet of nodes of any kind, and you'll be prompted for a filename to write to.

NOTE:
    This function can also be called via python.

    {{{
    #!python
    from OD import shelftools
    shelftools.exportNetwork(nodeFile=None, mode = None, nodes=None)

    # nodeFile: Filename to be written, if none is given, you will be prompted
    # mode    : Export Mode: 0 = All; 1 = Selected Only
    # nodes   : Array of Nodes to export (can be a single [node])
    }}}
