= Import Node Network =

"""Allows the import of nodes that were saved via the Export Node Network."""

This makes it easy to load/save specific setups and exchange them between sessions of Houdini.  You will be prompted via a file requester to select a file that was written via the Export Node tool.

NOTE:
    This function can also be called via python.

    {{{
    #!python
    from OD import shelftools
    shelftools.importNetwork(file=None)

    # if no file is given, you'll pre prompted to select a file for import
    }}}
