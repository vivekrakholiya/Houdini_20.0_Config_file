= Points to Clipboard for Curve Sop =

"""Accumulates the current position of points to be used in a Curve Sop."""

A lot of times when working with the curve sop it is difficult to arrange multiple points at the same time, ie. flattening a curve, so usually a transform, or edit sop used.  However, doing so, takes away the ability to simply drag the points via the curve sop's UI.

This tool takes the current nodes's position of points, in their order, and arranges it in a way to be used within the Curve Sops' coordinate parm.  The original node does not have to be curve sop, but it is typically how this tool is being used.

After you run the tool on the selected node, simply paste the result into the coordinate parm of the Curve sop.
