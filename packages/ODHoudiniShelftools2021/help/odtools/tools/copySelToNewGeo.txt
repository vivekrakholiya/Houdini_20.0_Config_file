= Copy Selection to New Geo =

"""Copy Sop Selection to New Geometry Container."""

This tool takes the currently selected sop nodes and copies them into a new geo container.  When multiple nodes are selected you can optionally create one new geo node per sop node.  

@parameters

::Copy Nodes:
    Copies the nodes and duplicates them in a new geo container

::Object Merge:
    Instead of copying, object merges the nodes into a new geo container.

::Single Geo Node:
    When Object Merge is selected and you have multiple selected nodes, all merges will be copied into a Single Geo Node.

::Multiple Geo Nodes:
    When Object Merge is selected and you have multiple selected nodes, each object merge will get its own Geo Node.
