= Save Selection to Hip =

"""Saves the current selection of nodes into a new separate HIP file."""

At times, you might want to branch of a selection of nodes into a new HIP file.  This takes the selected nodes, and writes them into a new
hip file.

NOTE:
    This function can also be called via python.

    {{{
    #!python
    from OD import shelftools
    shelftools.saveNodesToNewFile(file=None, nodes=None)

    # if no file is given, you'll pre prompted to select a file for import
    # nodes: an array of nodes to be written to a new hip file.
    }}}
