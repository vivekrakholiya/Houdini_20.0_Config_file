"""Creates an OpenGL Viewport overlay for a camera."""

The Source Hip File is automatically added as well as the camera name and lens information.

This could generally be used for creating a default state that gets loaded before the "state file".  So you could for example set all objects visible in the base state, and then choose selected objects to be disabled for the other state file.
