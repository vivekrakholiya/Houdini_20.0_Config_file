= Create OUT Null =

"""Creates and 'OUT' Null to the output of the currently selected node."""

Common Houdini workflow, is to create an 'OUT' Null that is appended to a Node.  The capital OUT, makes the OUT null appear at the top of Object Lists, making it easy to connect to when an object parm exists.  
Additionally, you can create an object merge which can then be used either within the same obj context or copied elsewhere.

This method is commonly used for keeping network flows tidy as its easy to eliminate criss-crossing connection wires.

NOTE:
    This function can also be called via python.

    {{{
    #!python
    from OD import shelftools
    shelftools.createSopOut(nodes=None, name=None, merges=None, randColor=True)

    # nodes is an array of nodes (if none are given, it takes the selected nodes)
    # name: basename to overwrite the name from the object when a single node is selected. if none is
    # given, the object name is used.
    # merges: True/False whether you want to create corresponding object_merge nodes
    # randColor: True/False whether you want to colorize the nodes with a random color to easily identify them
    }}}
