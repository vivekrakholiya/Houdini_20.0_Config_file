"""Lets you convert a Quixel imported asset into an Octane Quick Material"""

This takes a Subnet generated by the Quixel bridge import and converts the materials to an Octane Quick Material.  This has a few benefits in terms of being able to see your textures within the openGL viewport, and in general being able to create an HDA with a transferable material.
