"""Move Sop Selection to New Geometry Container & object merge connected, but unselected Nodes."""

This tool takes the currently selected sop nodes and moves them into a new geo container.  For any connected nodes that are not part of the original selection, Object Merges are created.  This greatly helps with the organizational nature of your network flow.
